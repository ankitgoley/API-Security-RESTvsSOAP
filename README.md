# Introduction to Web Services
A Web service is a standardized way of establishing communication between two Web-based applications by using open standards over an internet protocol backbone. It’s the best way to communicate with different applications who are developed on different platform.

As you can see in the figure, java, .net or PHP applications can communicate with other applications through web service over the network. For example, java application can interact with Java, .Net and PHP applications. So, web service is a language independent way of communication.
# Difference between Web applications and Web services
A web application is an application that is accessed through a web browser running on a client’s machine whereas a web service is a system of software that allows different machines to interact with each other through a network. Most of the times, web services do not necessarily have a user interface since it’s used as a component in an application, while a web application is a complete application with a GUI. Furthermore, web services will take a web application to the next level because it’s used to communicate or transfer data between web applications that run on different platforms allowing it to support a heterogeneous environment.
# Why we use web services?
A web service is a unit of managed code that can be remotely invoked using HTTP, that is, it can be activated using HTTP requests. Web services allows you to expose the functionality of your existing code over the network. Once it is exposed on the network, other application can use the functionality of your program.

# Web services have some added advantages, some of them are listed below:
            1.Language Independent
            2.Platform Independent (Hardware and OS)
            3.Function Reusability
            4.Stateless communication

# Type of web services
            1. SOAP web services
            2. RESTful web services
           
# SOAP
SOAP is a protocol which was designed before REST and came into the picture. The main idea behind designing SOAP was to ensure that programs built on different platforms and programming languages could exchange data in an easy manner.

# Components of SOAP web services
            1.XML (Extensible Markup Language)
            2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
            3.WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
            4.UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)
